###Deploying Cisco Umbrella Roaming Client with Kaseya

The Cisco Umbrella roaming client can be deployed using RMM tools, such as Kaseya, by applying the <a href="https://docs.umbrella.com/product/msp/automated-deployment/#section-deployment-parameters">correct parameters</a> as part of the install string.  

<div>
<table style="height: 100px; width: 100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td bgcolor="#ffffcc">
				<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This document is specific to deploying the Umbrella roaming client on Windows client operating systems, such as Windows 8 or 10. The installation of the Umbrella roaming client on Windows Server operating systems is not supported. A complete list of prerequisites are available <a href="https://docs.umbrella.com/product/msp/prerequisites/">here</a>. This document assumes you've read these prerequisites and have opened the appropriate firewall ports.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>


<div>
<table style="align:center"><colgroup><col width="624" /></colgroup>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td bgcolor="#ccffff">You must enter all customer internal domains before deploying the Umbrella roaming client. Failure to do so will cause problems with accessing internal resources. To do this, in the Umbrella dashboard navigate to Settings > Internal Domains and enter domains as required. For details about what needs to be in this list, please see  <a href="https://docs.umbrella.com/product/msp/appendix-d-internal-domains/">this support article</a>.

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
</div>

To download the script, you can find the [full script here](https://github.com/opendns/Deploy-Scripts/blob/master/Kaseya/Umbrella_Roaming_Client.xml).
If you aren't familiar with GitHub, we recommend importing the script properly by clicking <strong>Raw</strong>.

<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/GitHub_Raw.png" border="0" alt="Scripts -> Raw">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

This will open the script into raw XML (see below) that you can copy/paste into your favorite text editor and save as an XML file.

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/GitHub_Raw2.png" border="0" alt="Raw XML"">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Once you have the file saved, now we can import into Kaseya.  To do that, navigate to Agent Procedures > Manage Procedures > Schedule / Create. Here you can select a folder in which to import the script, and then click Import Folder/Procedure:

<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/Import_XML.png" border="0" alt="Parameters from OpenDNS Dashboard">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Choose the file to upload, and then click "Save."

<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/Import_XML2.png" border="0" alt="Parameters from OpenDNS Dashboard">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Now you should see the newly imported script in the selected folder.

<table style="width:75%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<center><img src="images/Script_Imported.png" border="0" alt="Script successfully imported!" style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

When running the script, you will be prompted to enter the <a href="https://docs.umbrella.com/product/msp/automated-deployment/#section-deployment-parameters">parameters</a> found in the Umbrella for MSPs Console.  

<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/Parameters-Prompt.png" border="0" alt="Prompt for parameters">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

In the Umbrella for MSPs Console you can find the ```User_ID```, ```Org_ID``` and ```Org_Fingerprint``` parameters by navigating to Customer Management and expanding a customer.
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/CustomerManagement.png" border="0" alt="Click the Caret">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
Parameters are located in the _Deployment Parameters_ section.  
<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/RoamingParameters.png" border="0" alt="Script Parameters">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

You have the option to hide the Add/Remove Programs entry and the System Tray icon by filling in the appropriate value.

To confirm the roaming client is checking in, log into your Umbrella Dashboard and choose the customer where you ran the deployment script. Navigate to Identities > Roaming Computers, and search for the individual host names where the script should have been run.  If the computer is checking in properly, youâ€™ll notice a green status icon as shown below:  

<table style="width:100%">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>
				<img src="images/PolicyStatus.png" border="0" alt="roaming client in Dashboard">
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Computers without a green status icon are not checking in properly with Umbrella.  Please check [this support article](https://docs.umbrella.com/product/msp/appendix-a-status-and-functionality/) for more information on the status icons and troubleshooting.
